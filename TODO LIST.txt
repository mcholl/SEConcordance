TODO LIST:

Locate_references
- Ideally, when I insert a reference into FoundRef, it should be unique for each sepost_id / reference combination.  Look into INSERT OR UPDATE for a fix.
- Verify the em dashes are being parsed correctly.  Also, in the database, change those to a regular dash.

Db.sql
- Get my personal credentials out of there (this on github after all!)

Make a webpage that lists posts by found references and links you to the post in SE
	<a href="{{found_ref.sepost.se_link}}">{{found_ref.sepost.title}}</a>  in template
Highlight the selected reference and show a snippet when you rollover the text
Be able to specify a range of verses to display
Be sure to credit biblia.com (see their website)


When it comes time to do a full-up import of hermeneutics and christianity, I should put a delay in there of 1 second per post.  I only get 5000 calls per hour, so a little bit of throttling is in order.

@done - add nChunkStart to the TextIndex start when scanning text for references. Otherwise, the index locations are off.

{% if found_references_list %}
	<ul>
	{% for found_ref in found_references_list %}
		<li>{{found_ref.reference}}</li>
	{% endfor %}
	</ul>
{% else %}
	<p>The Concordance is currently empty!</p>
{% endif %}
