TODO LIST:

Locate_references
- Ideally, when I insert a reference into FoundRef, it should be unique for each sepost_id / reference combination.  Look into INSERT OR UPDATE for a fix. 
- Handle duplicate post
- Handle encoding better.  (fancy quotes)

Db.sql

Views

Highlight the selected reference and show a snippet when you rollover the text
Be able to specify a range of verses to display
Be sure to credit biblia.com (see their website)
Add C.SE style sheets

When it comes time to do a full-up import of hermeneutics and christianity, I should put a delay in there of 1 second per post.  I only get 5000 calls per hour, so a little bit of throttling is in order.

Known Limitations:
- Only the 66 books of the Protestant canon are recognized by the Biblia parser.  I'd need to get a lot more sophisticated before I can get Deuterocanonical or LDS scriptures recorginzed.

@done - add nChunkStart to the TextIndex start when scanning text for references. Otherwise, the index locations are off.
@done - Get my personal credentials out of Db.sql (this on github after all!)
@done - I had the name of revelation wrong & every index needed to be bumped up by 1 - so I need to reimport :)
@done - Verify the em dashes are being parsed correctly.  Also, in the database, change those to a regular dash.
@done Make a webpage that lists posts by found references and links you to the post in SE
	<a href="{{found_ref.sepost.se_link}}">{{found_ref.sepost.title}}</a>  in template
