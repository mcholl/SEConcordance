TODO LIST:

Locate_references
- Ideally, when I insert a reference into FoundRef, it should be unique for each sepost_id / reference combination.  Look into INSERT OR UPDATE for a fix.
- add nChunkStart to the TextIndex start when scanning text for references. Otherwise, the index locations are off.

Db.sql
- Get my personal credentials out of there (this on github after all!)

Make a webpage that lists posts by found references and links you to the post in SE
Highlight the selected reference and show a snippet when you rollover the text
Be able to specify a range of verses to display
