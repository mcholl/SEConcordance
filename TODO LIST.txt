SEConcordance To Do Items

Locate_references:
	- @bug Import failed when I triggered the try: except. @done(2014-03-09)
	- @bug My encoding doesn't handle Greek and Hebrew characters.  Should be fixed!
	- @bug &quot; and &#39; need to be replaced.  (HTML Entities as a whole…) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2087370/decode-html-entities-in-python-string
	- @bug If the owner has deleted himself, owner display name doesn't come through. e.g.: http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/8527.  In these instances, just handle the owner name... 
	- @bug Question: How do I keep the scores up to date? 
		I suppose I could write a second agent that would simply retrieve the current score (maybe score, up & down votes!) on each post, and each entry.   Currently, the activity on Christianity is that I can import a year's worth of data, and parse it, in under an hour.  Just retriving all the scores - especially since there would be no posting, then updating each record in the table, really wouldn't be that big of a deal...
	- Consider using authetication credentials to just show the up/down split?
Views:
	- Add a /search/url that would let you search the body and title of posts within a specific canoncial range.
	- Highlight the found reference in some fashion (background-color: yellow?) or at least tag the found thing...
Visualization:
	- At some point, I want a graph that shows the number of times each book / chapter is referenced in an answer :)

Known Limitations:
	- Question: Should I also be parsing MiYodeya in addition to herm & c.se?
		I can ask Shog or Monica Cellio, but I think the answer is no - there is much more midrash and less Torah.
	- No parsing of LDS books.  And, if the Biblia API ever goes away, I'd need to rewrite it...
Deployment:
	- Do a full import from Jan 01 2011
	- Schedule the import to run on a schedule
	- Publicize it / Sell it

	- Consider saving the current state of the filters in a cookie, and restoring them @done(2014-03-04) @project(Views)
		Answer: No.  It's a lot of work to write, and not really something the user especially expects...	
	- @bug Why is the line missing between questions sometimes? @done(2014-03-04) @project(Views)
		Interesting - it is a border-bottom on all .answer, but not on .question… Why? Just the way the style sheet was done.  I'm overrideing for my needs.
	- @bug Some bodies have \' in them.  I should check my escaping sequences... @done(2014-03-04) @project(Locate_references)
	- @bug Why am I sometimes failing to start a new <TR> on certain questions? @done(2014-03-04) @project(Views)
		Hypothesis: What if I'm getting a set of found_refs - an append vs. a join or whatever...
		Nope: The answer had to do with autoescape.  With autoescape off, if the snippet broke while, say, an open tag was being shown, it would throw off the rest of the row.  For now, I can just do autoescaping of the title, owner, and references - but I wonder if I need to do a more intelligent parsing of the snippet…  In some ways, stripping out the tags might actually be a good idea...
	- @bug Why doesn't per_page_count set correctly? It keeps sticking at 50 - even though the url changes correctly! @done(2014-03-04) @project(Views)
	- Have a mechanism for altering the filters  @done(2014-03-04) @project(Views)
		- button to hide / unhide settings (jqueryui) @done(2014-03-04)
		- <SELECT> to set the type='hiddens', then do a submit @done(2014-03-04)
		- Set the initial value of the dropdowns based on what is selected @done(2014-03-04)
	- Persist veiwing prefs across Next / Previous etc… (use INPUT type='hidden') @done(2014-03-04) @project(Views)
	- Maybe identify whether it is C.SE or Herm? @done(2014-03-04)
	
	- Be able to hide negatively scoring answers @done(2014-03-04)
	- Allow the user to restricting the list of displayed items to 30, 50, or 100. @done(2014-03-04)
	- Make the Score more visible, like the votes on the main page of C.SE. @done(2014-03-04)
	- It would be a nice touch if ref.ly could tag whole chapters (e.g. Genesis 1:1 works, but Genesis 1 does not) @done(2014-03-04)
	- Consider adding a thing to let you choose books by clicking wit the mouse rather than typing @done(2014-03-04)
	- Question: Can I do the search update in a more Ajaxy fashion?  (Do I want to?) @done(2014-03-04)
	- Why is the image missing on the Biblia shoutout? @done(2014-03-04)
	- Log errors in a separate log file!  Ideally, I'd actually email that log to myself at the end, so that I see the errors! @done(2014-03-04)
	- Handle encoding better.  (fancy quotes) @done(2014-03-04)
	- Get rid of &quot; (") and &#39; (') @done(2014-03-04)
	- I still have URLs, which after encoding, are still > 2000, and generate a 404.  I really need to get that right @done(2014-03-04)
	
	- Make the Admin Interface usable by having the VerseReference and SEPost objects display meaningful information @done(2014-03-04)
	- Consider hiding the Author / Score information to the rollover, along with the snippet @done(2014-03-04)
	- Highlight the selected reference and show a snippet when you rollover the text. Note, the snippets are currently on the page, but I have them hidden for readibility. @done(2014-03-04)
							<span class='classic'>{{found_ref.preview_snippet}}</span>
						Actually, I like having the preview like the main does.  So, no need for hover!
	- Be able to hide questions or answers @done(2014-03-04)
		{%if found_ref.sepost.score > 0 %}positive{% elif found_ref.sepost.score == 0 %}zero{% else %}negative{% endif %} {%if found_ref.sepost.qa == 'q' %}question{% else %}answer{% endif %}
		Note: Actually, this is where I'd want a Manager - for .scored.positive, .scored.positiveorzero, .questions, .answers… Thta way, pagination works correctly :)
	- Reimport, because I've changed books and added encoding!! @done(2014-03-03)
	- Handle a bogus search filter criteria @done(2014-03-04)
		I've gotten it to send out a 404 if you pass bogus references.  Probably I should have a friendly page that says "That isn't a book range I understand"
	@done Db.sql: @project(@done Db.sql)
	
	@done Search: @project(@done Search)
	
	- Implement paging,  @done(2014-03-03)
	- I have the main search functionality has been implemented, but right now, I can't search beyond a single book - because my BibleReference object only has start book but no end book.  I need to expand that and the raw sql in the view in order to allow for a range of say Matthew - John (e.g. "Gospels")  Additionally, I should consider adding some keyword search ranges, as well as a graphical verse picker for this purpose... @done(2014-03-03) 
	- Test MultiBook filter ranges after  new import @done(2014-03-03)
	- Question: Does Biblia parse out LDS books? @done(2014-03-03) Nope!
	
	
	@done  Not exactly true - apocraphyal books are recognized
	- Only the 66 books of the Protestant canon are recognized by the Biblia parser.  I'd need to get a lot more sophisticated before I can get Deuterocanonical or LDS scriptures recorginzed. @done(2014-03-03)
	@done - add nChunkStart to the TextIndex start when scanning text for references. Otherwise, the index locations are off.
	@done - Get my personal credentials out of Db.sql (this on github after all!)
	@done - I had the name of revelation wrong & every index needed to be bumped up by 1 - so I need to reimport :)
	@done - Verify the em dashes are being parsed correctly.  Also, in the database, change those to a regular dash.
	@done Make a webpage that lists posts by found references and links you to the post in SE
		<a href="{{found_ref.sepost.se_link}}">{{found_ref.sepost.title}}</a>  in template
	
	
		SELECT * FROM concordance_reference WHERE ref_book_num=%s AND ref_endchapter_num >= %s AND ref_endverse_num >= %s AND ref_startchapter_num <= %s AND ref_startverse_num <= %s
	@done - Ideally, when I insert a reference into FoundRef, it should be unique for each sepost_id / reference combination.  Look into INSERT OR UPDATE for a fix. (Netter solution - I do a DELETE before insert, thus getting rid of the old references!)
	@done - Handle duplicate post
	@done - Note: My search filter is going to be wrong if I do something like Matthew 1 - 20.  Verses in Chapter 20 will be forgotten, because 20:1 > 20:0.  Basically I need to add a thing that says 0 = 1000
	@done Be able to specify a range of verses to display
	@done Add C.SE style sheets
	@done When it comes time to do a full-up import of hermeneutics and christianity, I should put a delay in there of 1 second per post.  I only get 5000 calls per hour, so a little bit of throttling is in order.
	@done - Have a search button that actually calls search
	@done - Incorporate the Score metric (and consider - up/downvote split instead of raw score?)
	@done - Tag the actual reference to biblia.
	@done - Be sure to credit biblia.com (see their website)
	@done - Fix the widths afforded to references and who answred
	@done - Note: I may want to consider using the /?tag biblia api to add reference tags to all answers, then looking for the <cites>  That way, I get hypertext links everywhere.


	@done - Interestingly, Biblia will parse out Apocraphyal books :)  I just need to add them to my array.
