TODO LIST:

Search
- I have the main search functionality has been implemented, but right now, I can't search beyond a single book - becaue my BibleReference object only has start book but no end book.  I need to expand that and the raw sql in the view in order to allow for a range of say Matthew - John (e.g. "Gospels")  Additionally, I should consider adding some keyword search ranges, as well as a graphical verse picker for this purpose...

Locate_references
- Handle encoding better.  (fancy quotes)
- I still have URLs, which after encoding, are still > 2000, and generate a 404.  I really need to get that right

- Interestingly, Biblia will parse out Apocraphyal books :)  I just need to add them to my array.
- Question: Does Biblia parse out LDS books?
- Log errors in a separate log file!  Ideally, I'd actually email that log to myself at the end, so that I see the errors!

Db.sql

Views
- Fix the widths afforded to references and who answred
- Incorporate the Score metric (and consider - up/downvote split instead of raw score?)
- Have a search button that actually calls search
- Highlight the selected reference and show a snippet when you rollover the text. Note, the snippets are currently on the page, but I have them hidden for readibility.
- Note: I may want to consider using the /?tag biblia api to add reference tags to all answers, then looking for the <cites>  That way, I get hypertext links everywhere.
- Be sure to credit biblia.com (see their website)
- Implement paging, restricting the list of displayed items to 30, 50, or 100.

Known Limitations:
- Only the 66 books of the Protestant canon are recognized by the Biblia parser.  I'd need to get a lot more sophisticated before I can get Deuterocanonical or LDS scriptures recorginzed.
  Not exactly true - apocraphyal books are recognized

@done - add nChunkStart to the TextIndex start when scanning text for references. Otherwise, the index locations are off.
@done - Get my personal credentials out of Db.sql (this on github after all!)
@done - I had the name of revelation wrong & every index needed to be bumped up by 1 - so I need to reimport :)
@done - Verify the em dashes are being parsed correctly.  Also, in the database, change those to a regular dash.
@done Make a webpage that lists posts by found references and links you to the post in SE
	<a href="{{found_ref.sepost.se_link}}">{{found_ref.sepost.title}}</a>  in template


	SELECT * FROM concordance_reference WHERE ref_book_num=%s AND ref_endchapter_num >= %s AND ref_endverse_num >= %s AND ref_startchapter_num <= %s AND ref_startverse_num <= %s
@done - Ideally, when I insert a reference into FoundRef, it should be unique for each sepost_id / reference combination.  Look into INSERT OR UPDATE for a fix. (Netter solution - I do a DELETE before insert, thus getting rid of the old references!)
@done - Handle duplicate post
@done - Note: My search filter is going to be wrong if I do something like Matthew 1 - 20.  Verses in Chapter 20 will be forgotten, because 20:1 > 20:0.  Basically I need to add a thing that says 0 = 1000
@done Be able to specify a range of verses to display
@done Add C.SE style sheets

@done When it comes time to do a full-up import of hermeneutics and christianity, I should put a delay in there of 1 second per post.  I only get 5000 calls per hour, so a little bit of throttling is in order.
