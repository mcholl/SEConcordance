          "body_markdown": "Biblically, there is no reason to bow to an image. God said don&#39;t do it. Man finds an excuse to do it. It is the reason that we have so many Christian denominations. The Bible says one thing, but people are either ignorant of what the Bible says, or choose not to do it. The Bible is the Word of God, and the Word of God has authority.\r\n\r\n&gt; Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any\r\n&gt; thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or\r\n&gt; that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself\r\n&gt; to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God,\r\n&gt; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third\r\n&gt; and fourth generation of them that hate me.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Ex, 20:4, 5\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Being then God&#39;s offspring, we ought not to think that the divine\r\n&gt; being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and\r\n&gt; imagination of man.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Acts 17:29\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my\r\n&gt; praise to carved idols.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Isaiah 42:8\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms\r\n&gt; himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and\r\n&gt; worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Isaiah 44:15\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; But what is God&#39;s reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand\r\n&gt; men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Romans 11:4\r\n\r\nSimply bowing the knee to an image is a direct offense to God, regardless of what it symbolizes.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to be insensitive to what others believe. Neither am I pointing fingers at any one denomination. I am simply stating what is in the Bible. If you don&#39;t think this is so, I simply ask, tell me where in the Bible it says it is RIGHT to bow to an image?",

But why do (some) Catholics also bow for icons of Mary?\r\n\r\nThere are numerous pages on the internet like [this one](http://www.godlovespeople.com/deceptions/maryiolatry.htm) where the author argues against this gesture. The reasoning is that it&#39;s against the commandment from Ex 20:4-5:\r\n\r\n&gt; Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot find arguments against this position. I guess there are, but what are they?",

Your question shows a lack of understanding of the basic nature of that the Bible ***is***.\r\n\r\nIt is ***not*** a collection of stories, showing heroes in a positive light.\r\n\r\nIt ***is*** a collection of books including teachings, but also, largely in the Old Testament in the Pentateuch and the Books of History, a book of ***history***.  In a historical book, at least one that is honest and accurate, the failures, frailties, and sins of the people chronicled are not covered up.\r\n\r\nLot&#39;s daughters are not the  only ones whose sin is shown.  Adam and Eve eating the apple, David&#39;s sin with Bathsheba, Solomon&#39;s pride, lust, and disobedience, and hundreds of others.  The Bible includes these sins because they happened, not because they are somehow approved of.  \r\n\r\nFar from it, in most of the cases, there are repercussions.  Perhaps not immediate, but they happen.  This is in line with God&#39;s nature.  He often gives people the chance to repent of their sins.\r\n\r\n&gt; **2 Peter 3:9 (KJV)**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count\r\n&gt; slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any\r\n&gt; should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_markdown": "According to the Bible, when *Lot* escaped out of *Zoar*, he went up to the mountains and settled in a cave. While in there,  he was seduced by his daughters so that they could bear children and save their family line. Here is the full account of the story incase someone wants to read it.\r\n\r\n&gt; #Lot and His Daughters#\r\n30.Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 31. And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. 32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” 33. So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.\r\n\r\n&gt; 34.The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” 35. So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 36. Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. 37. The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab.&#160;[2] He is the father of the Moabites to this day. 38. The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi.&#160;[3] He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.\r\n\r\n&gt; *Crossway Bibles (2011-02-09).

Was *Lot* really drunk to a point that he didn&#39;t know what he was doing? Was it a mistake on the daughters&#39; side? If yes, why didn&#39;t he(Lot) take any action afterward?
