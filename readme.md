===

A [Concordance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(publishing)) is a work that extracts every key word in a text and lists them in a useful order. Key to just about any bible study is a concordance, like [Strong's](http://www.biblestudytools.com/concordances/strongs-exhaustive-concordance/) famous one, that extracts keywords from the bible, and lists every reference in canonical order.  Unlike Strongs, this concordance doesn't extract words from the bible, but rather references used in an answers on the various religious Stack Exchange sites (Christianity, Hermeneutics, and Judiasm).

This tool is useful for understanding what questions people ask about subjects in a particular canonical range.  If, for example, you were interested in 'grace' in the old testament, it might useful to see what answers people wrote about that in Stack Exchange, when they used a reference in Gen-Mal. 

The site works by mining question and answers, parsing them for references, and then storing the result in a database.  The power of the site is its listing of references in canonical order, and the ability to search and filter the results.
